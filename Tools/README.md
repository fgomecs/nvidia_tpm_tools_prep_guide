# Developer Tools (Compute Workflow)

**Why It Matters**: The TPM role centers on managing compute developer tools like Nsight, cuDNN, TensorRT, and NIM, which optimize GPU workflows for AI/ML. GTC 2024/2025 highlighted Nsight for profiling and NIM for inference ease, and X raves about NIM’s developer-friendly APIs.

**Depth**: Know each tool’s purpose and how you’d manage their delivery (e.g., roadmaps, feedback loops). No setup or coding details—focus on coordination and use cases.

**Time**: 3-4 hours over 2 days.

**Resume Tie-In**: Your VMware adoption boost (10%) and Microsoft cybersecurity features show you can drive tool success. Use your dashboards and Agile experience to discuss tool management.

## Checklist

- [ ] **Nsight Tools** (1 hour)  
  URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-tools  
  Read: Main page.  
  Goal: Understand Nsight Compute (GPU profiling) and Nsight Systems (system-wide debugging) for optimizing CUDA apps. Developers use them to find bottlenecks in AI code. GTC 2024 showcased Nsight’s role in LLM tuning.  
  **Key Point**: “Nsight helps developers debug and profile CUDA apps, and I’d ensure it meets user needs, like my VMware adoption projects.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Say: “Nsight’s profiling is like my Microsoft dashboards—I’d prioritize features developers need.” Be ready to pivot to coordination if tech gets deep.  
  **Resume Link**: Compare to your VMware BI team—both deliver performance insights.

- [ ] **cuDNN and TensorRT** (1-2 hours)  
  URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn  
  URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt  
  Skim: Intro sections.  
  Goal: Learn cuDNN as a library for deep learning primitives (e.g., convolutions, activations) and TensorRT for optimizing inference (e.g., faster model deployment). Both speed AI on GPUs. GTC 2024 tied them to LLM efficiency.  
  **Key Point**: “cuDNN and TensorRT accelerate AI training and inference, and I’d manage their roadmaps to support developers, like my Microsoft security features.”  
  **Interview Tip**: If asked, say: “I’d align cuDNN/TensorRT updates with developer feedback, using Agile like my VMware work.” Don’t worry about APIs—focus on delivery.  
  **Resume Link**: Link to your Microsoft ML model reuse—both optimize compute tasks.

- [ ] **NIM (Inference Microservices)** (1 hour)  
  URL: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring24-s62003/  
  Watch: First 10 min.  
  Goal: Know NIM as a tool for deploying AI models via APIs, simplifying inference for developers (e.g., chatbots, image recognition). GTC 2024 pitched it as “AI in a box.” X loves its ease.  
  **Key Point**: “NIM streamlines AI inference with APIs, and I’d align its roadmap with developer needs, like my Microsoft provisioning schedules.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Say: “NIM’s simplicity is like my VMware adoption focus—I’d ensure it delights developers.” Mention X buzz casually.  
  **Resume Link**: Tie to your Microsoft dashboards—both track user success.

## Notes
- **X Buzz**: NIM’s APIs are trending for fast AI deployment. Say: “X posts praise NIM’s developer ease.”  
- **GTC 2024**: NIM launched as a game-changer for inference—note “microservices” term.  
- **Avoid**: Skip setup details or niche tools (e.g., cuQuantum). Focus on these four.  
- **Practice**: Explain tools in 2 sentences: “Nsight, cuDNN, TensorRT, and NIM optimize GPU workflows for AI. I’d manage their delivery to empower developers, like my VMware projects.”
