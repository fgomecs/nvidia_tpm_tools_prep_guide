## Example: Using NVIDIA Tools with Python
NVIDIA tools like Nsight Systems and Compute Sanitizer can be used with Python-based CUDA development via libraries like Numba, which allows writing CUDA kernels without `.cu` files. Below is an example of a vector addition kernel written in Python using Numba, which can be profiled and debugged with NVIDIA tools.

```python
import numpy as np
from numba import cuda

@cuda.jit
def add_vectors(a, b, c, n):
    idx = cuda.grid(1)
    if idx < n:
        c[idx] = a[idx] + b[idx]

n = 10000
a = np.random.random(n).astype(np.float32)
b = np.random.random(n).astype(np.float32)
c = np.zeros(n, dtype=np.float32)

d_a = cuda.to_device(a)
d_b = cuda.to_device(b)
d_c = cuda.to_device(c)

threads_per_block = 256
blocks_per_grid = (n + threads_per_block - 1) // threads_per_block

add_vectors[blocks_per_grid, threads_per_block](d_a, d_b, d_c, n)

c = d_c.copy_to_host()
print(c[:5])
```

  - **Nsight Systems**: Profiles the Python script to visualize GPU kernel execution and CPU-GPU interactions, helping identify performance bottlenecks.
  - **Nsight Compute**: Provides detailed metrics on the `add_vectors` kernel’s performance, such as memory usage and execution time.
  - **Compute Sanitizer**: Checks for memory errors in the CUDA kernel, ensuring reliability.
  - **CUDA-GDB**: Debugs the kernel if issues arise, though Python integration may require additional setup.
