# GPU Families (Compute-Focused)

**Why It Matters**: GPUs are the hardware foundation for developer tools, and your role requires understanding compute platforms (not gaming ones). GTC 2024/2025 spotlighted H100 for AI, Blackwell for scale, and Rubin as future-proofing. X praises H100’s dominance and Blackwell’s potential.

**Depth**: Cover H100, Blackwell, and Rubin for AI/compute use cases. Skip GeForce (gaming) or older architectures (Ampere). Know how GPUs support tools and your TPM coordination.

**Time**: 2-3 hours in 1 day.

**Resume Tie-In**: Your data center experience (space/cooling/power constraints) aligns with GPU cluster management. Use your $1.5M HP cost savings to show optimization skills for GPU tool projects.

## Checklist

- [ ] **H100 Overview** (1 hour)  
  URL: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/  
  Read: Main page.  
  Goal: Know H100 as the leading GPU for AI training/inference, used in DGX H100 systems. Its Tensor Cores accelerate ML math (e.g., matrix operations). GTC 2024 called it the “AI workhorse.”  
  **Key Point**: “H100 GPUs drive AI with Tensor Cores, powering tools for model optimization and training.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Say: “H100’s AI power is like the compute clusters I provisioned at Microsoft—I’d ensure tools leverage it.” Don’t memorize FLOPS; focus on use cases.  
  **Resume Link**: Link to your Microsoft server scale—both handle high-performance compute.

- [ ] **Blackwell and Rubin** (1-2 hours)  
  URL: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring25-a41247/  
  Skim: First 5 min.  
  Goal: Understand Blackwell (GB200, B300) for larger memory and better AI reasoning, used in DGX systems. Rubin (2026) introduces HBM4 memory for future AI scale. GTC 2025 hyped Blackwell Ultra.  
  **Key Point**: “Blackwell GPUs like GB200 scale AI, and I’d ensure tools support their deployment, like my HP cost optimizations.”  
  **Interview Tip**: If asked about future tech, say: “Blackwell and Rubin push AI boundaries, and I’d align tool roadmaps to their rollout, like my VMware governance.” Mention GTC casually.  
  **Resume Link**: Tie to your HP lean strategies—both optimize for scale.

## Notes
- **X Buzz**: H100 rules AI, Blackwell excites for memory. Say: “X posts call Blackwell a game-changer for AI.”  
- **GTC 2025**: Blackwell Ultra and Rubin signal long-term AI focus—note “trillion-parameter” models.  
- **Avoid**: Skip specs (e.g., CUDA cores). Focus on how GPUs enable tools.  
- **Practice**: Explain GPUs in 2 sentences: “H100 and Blackwell GPUs accelerate AI with Tensor Cores. I’d manage tools to optimize their use, like my data center projects.”
