# Daily Study Plan

**Goal**: Achieve “dangerous” fluency in NVIDIA’s compute developer tools for the TPM role in 12-18 hours, preparing you to discuss CUDA, DGX, GPUs, and tools confidently.

**Approach**: Skim intros and videos (10-15 min each), focus on use cases, and tie to your resume (e.g., Microsoft provisioning, VMware adoption). Practice 1-2 sentence explanations for each topic to nail interviews.

**Time**: 2-3 hours/day over 3-6 days.

**Resume Tie-In**: Use your $300M server project, ML model work, and $1.5M cost savings to show you can manage compute toolchains, aligning teams and tracking progress like you’ll do at NVIDIA.

## 4-Day Schedule (Adjust for 3-6 Days)

- [X] **Day 1: CUDA Basics** (3 hours)  
  Tasks: What is CUDA?, Key Terms.  
  URLs:  
  - https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit  
  - https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/  
  Practice: “CUDA enables GPU parallel tasks like AI training, and I’d manage its tools like my Microsoft dashboards.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Be ready for: “How does CUDA fit in tools?” Use your VMware governance example to show coordination.  
  **Resume Link**: Link to your ML model adaptation—both leverage compute.

- [x] **Day 2: DGX and GPUs** (3 hours)  
  Tasks: DGX Overview, H100 Overview.  
  URLs:  
  - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/  
  - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/h100/  
  Practice: “DGX scales AI with H100 GPUs, and I’d coordinate its tools like my Microsoft provisioning.”  
  **Interview Tip**: If asked about scaling, say: “I’d use my Microsoft scheduling to ensure DGX tool delivery.” Mention Spark’s developer focus.  
  **Resume Link**: Tie to your zero-waste ops—both optimize compute.

- [x] **Day 3: GPUs and Tools** (3 hours)  
  Tasks: Blackwell/Rubin, Nsight Tools, cuDNN.  
  URLs:  
  - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring25-a41247/  
  - https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-tools  
  - https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn  
  Practice: “Blackwell powers AI tools like Nsight, which I’d deliver like my VMware adoption projects.”  
  **Interview Tip**: For tools, say: “I’d align Nsight features with developers, using Agile like VMware.” Pivot to management if tech gets deep.  
  **Resume Link**: Compare to your BI team launch—both deliver insights.

- [ ] **Day 4: Tools and Review** (3 hours)  
  Tasks: TensorRT, NIM, review all topics.  
  URLs:  
  - https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt  
  - https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring24-s62003/  
  Practice: “NIM simplifies inference, and I’d manage it like my Microsoft schedules.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Be ready for: “How would you manage NIM’s roadmap?” Use your dashboard experience.  
  **Resume Link**: Link to your cybersecurity features—both enhance user workflows.

## Optional Days 5-6
- Revisit weak spots (e.g., CUDA terms if confusing).  
- Watch another GTC talk (20 min): https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/ (pick an AI tools session).  
- Practice mock questions: “How do CUDA and DGX support developers?” or “How would you prioritize tool features?”  
  **Example Answer**: “CUDA and DGX power AI tools like Nsight and NIM, and I’d prioritize developer feedback to deliver them, like my VMware 10% adoption boost.”

## Notes
- **X Buzz**: CUDA, NIM, and DGX Spark are trending for AI ease. Say: “I’ve seen NIM’s APIs hyped on X.”  
- **GTC 2024/2025**: Note terms like “AI factory” (DGX), “trillion-parameter” (Blackwell), “microservices” (NIM).  
- **Interview Strategy**: If unsure, say: “I’m familiar with CUDA’s role and eager to learn NVIDIA’s toolchain specifics.” Honesty shows growth.  
- **Practice**: Run through all key points aloud (2 min each topic) to sound natural.

## NVIDIA Alignment
## NVIDIA Alignment
- **TPM Track Record**: Managed Microsoft’s 15,000-server rollout, delivering concurrent cloud releases on inflexible schedules across matrixed teams (engineering, supply chain).
- **JIRA Experience**: Used JIRA for roadmapping at VMware, acting as project admin to track 100+ tasks, ensuring zero delays. Practiced scenario: prioritizing Nsight feature bugs.
- **Process Improvement**: Streamlined VMware BI workflows, boosting adoption 10% via automated dashboards, similar to NVIDIA’s tool delivery needs.
- **Practice**: “I’d drive NVIDIA’s releases with JIRA, like my Microsoft ops ensured flawless execution.”
