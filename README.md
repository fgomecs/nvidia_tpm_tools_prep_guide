# NVIDIA TPM Tools Prep Guide

*by Francisco Gomez - April, 2025*

This repository serves as a preparation guide for my interview for the **Technical Program Manager - Compute Developer Tools** role at NVIDIA, scheduled for Friday, April 18, 2025. It organizes key concepts, tools, and resources to align with the [job description](https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite/job/Technical-Program-Manager---Compute-Developer-Tools_JR1995794-1), focusing on compute developer tools like CUDA, Nsight, and related technologies. Below are the subfolders, each covering a critical area to ensure I focus on the right topics for the interview.

## Subfolders

- [CUDA](./CUDA/README.md)  
  Covers foundational CUDA concepts like kernels, threads, and memory management. Includes sample code (e.g., `array_add.cu`) to demonstrate parallel programming, central to NVIDIA’s compute tools.

- [DGX](./DGX/README.md)  
  Explores NVIDIA DGX systems, the backbone for AI and compute workloads. Includes notes on how these platforms support developers, relevant for discussing scalability.

- [GPUs](./GPUs/README.md)  
  Provides an overview of NVIDIA’s GPU compute stack (e.g., H100, Blackwell). Useful for discussing how to align tools with NVIDIA’s hardware ecosystem.

- [Plan](./Plan/README.md)  
  Focuses on TPM skills like roadmapping, stakeholder communication, and risk management. Includes scenarios to showcase cross-functional project leadership.

- [Tools](./Tools/README.md)  
  Explores developer workflows, including build systems, CI/CD, and SDK usage. Helps articulate how to streamline processes for NVIDIA’s compute ecosystem.

- [Nsight](./Nsight/README.md)  
  Details NVIDIA Nsight tools (Nsight Compute, Nsight Systems) for profiling and debugging. Contains notes and examples on performance optimization, critical for supporting developer workflows.

- [AI Workflows](./AI%20Workflows/README.md)  
  Covers AI tools like cuDNN and TensorRT for model training and inference, key for NVIDIA’s developer ecosystem.

- [Collaboration](./Collaboration/README.md)  
  Details cross-functional strategies for aligning engineering, product teams, and leadership.

- [SDKs](./SDKs/README.md)  
  Explores NVIDIA SDKs like CUDA Toolkit and DRIVE, critical for managing developer tools.

## Preparation Plan

With the interview on Friday, I’ll prioritize:
- **CUDA**: Review code daily to explain parallel computing confidently.
- **Nsight**: Practice profiling examples to discuss optimization strategies.
- **Plan**: Rehearse TPM scenarios to highlight leadership skills.
- **Tools, GPUs, DGX**: Skim for context to tie tools to NVIDIA’s mission.
- **AI Workflows, Collaboration, SDKs**: Add one (e.g., AI Workflows) by Thursday and skim 1-2 hours.

This setup uses GitHub’s Markdown for easy navigation, like a OneNote, keeping my prep streamlined.
