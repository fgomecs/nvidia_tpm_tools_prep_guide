# NVIDIA TPM Tools Prep Guide

*by Francisco Gomez - April 2025*

This repository is my study hub for the **Technical Program Manager - Compute Developer Tools** interview at NVIDIA, set for Friday, April 18, 2025. It aligns with the [job description](https://nvidia.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/NVIDIAExternalCareerSite/job/Technical-Program-Manager---Compute-Developer-Tools_JR1995794-1), emphasizing technical program management, GPU programming (CUDA, Nsight), and process optimization in matrixed teams. With 15+ years managing complex software and cloud projects (e.g., Microsoft’s 15,000-server provisioning), I’ve tailored this guide to showcase my track record of timely delivery, problem-solving, and innovation for NVIDIA’s compute ecosystem.

## Subfolders

- [CUDA](./CUDA/README.md)  
  Covers CUDA programming (kernels, threads, memory), with code like `array_add.cu` to show GPU expertise. Highlights my ability to support developers, critical for NVIDIA’s tools.

- [DGX](./DGX/README.md)  
  Explores DGX systems for AI/compute workloads. Ties to my experience scaling data center projects, ensuring flawless execution.

- [GPUs](./GPUs/README.md)  
  Details NVIDIA’s GPU stack (H100, Blackwell). Supports my understanding of hardware-software integration for multi-platform delivery.

- [Plan](./Plan/README.md)  
  Focuses on TPM skills: roadmapping, risk management, JIRA workflows. Showcases my history leading concurrent schedules in matrixed teams, with scenarios reflecting process improvements.

- [Tools](./Tools/README.md)  
  Covers developer workflows (CI/CD, SDKs). Demonstrates my automation experience, streamlining processes like my VMware BI launch.

- [Nsight](./Nsight/README.md)  
  Details Nsight Compute/Systems for profiling/debugging. Highlights my grasp of code optimization tools, key to standing out.

- [AI_Workflows](./AI_Workflows/README.md)  
  Explores cuDNN/TensorRT for AI training/inference. Ties to my ML analytics (Python, LSTM), showing innovation in developer ecosystems.

- [Collaboration](./Collaboration/README.md)  
  Covers cross-functional alignment (Agile, RACI). Reflects my problem-solving in matrixed organizations, like Microsoft’s zero-downtime ops.

- [SDKs](./SDKs/README.md)  
  Details CUDA Toolkit, DRIVE SDKs. Showcases my systems software experience, with automation insights from cloud projects.

## Preparation Plan

With the interview tomorrow, I’ll prioritize NVIDIA’s key needs:
- **CUDA/Nsight** (1 hour): Review `CUDA` code and `Nsight` profiling to nail GPU programming questions. Practice: “CUDA accelerates AI, and Nsight optimizes it, like my analytics.”
- **Plan/Collaboration** (1 hour): Rehearse `Plan` scenarios (JIRA, roadmapping) and `Collaboration` (RACI, conflict). Practice: “I’d align teams with JIRA, like my Microsoft sync.”
- **AI_Workflows** (30 min): Skim `AI_Workflows` (TensorRT). Practice: “cuDNN speeds training, like my ML project.”
- **DGX/GPUs/Tools/SDKs** (30 min): Quick review for ecosystem context. Practice: “NVIDIA’s stack drives innovation, like my VMware process tweaks.”
- **JIRA/Automation** (30 min): Note JIRA admin experience (from VMware) and automation (Python scripts). Commit notes to `Plan`/`Tools`.

This Markdown hub ensures I navigate topics fast, tying my 7+ years in systems software and process improvements to NVIDIA’s needs. Ready to deliver flawless execution tomorrow!
