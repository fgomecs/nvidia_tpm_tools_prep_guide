# Collaboration (Cross-Functional Alignment)

**Why It Matters**: The TPM role requires collaborating with engineering, product teams, and leadership to deliver compute developer tools—a core skill for driving NVIDIA’s projects. Effective collaboration ensures tools like Nsight and CUDA meet developer needs. GTC 2025 emphasized team alignment for AI innovation, and cross-functional success is a hot topic in tech discussions.

**Depth**: Understand collaboration frameworks (e.g., Agile, stakeholder mapping) and how they apply to NVIDIA’s ecosystem. Focus on resolving conflicts, gathering requirements, and aligning teams, not technical minutiae. Emphasize your role in facilitating communication and delivering on time.

**Time**: 2-3 hours over 1 day.

**Resume Tie-In**: Your Microsoft provisioning (15,000 servers) and VMware governance show you can align diverse teams. Link collaboration to your dashboards for stakeholder sync or your BI team launch (10% adoption increase).

## Checklist

- [ ] **Collaboration Basics** (1 hour)  
  URL: https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring25-a41250/  
  Watch: First 10 min (~Mar 2025, signup needed).  
  Goal: Learn how NVIDIA teams collaborate on AI tools (e.g., CUDA, Nsight). Note Agile practices and stakeholder roles (engineers, PMs, devs). GTC 2025 highlighted cross-team sync for Blackwell tools.  
  **Key Point**: “Collaboration drives tool delivery, and I’d align teams like I did at Microsoft for zero-downtime ops.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Say: “I’d use Agile to sync engineering and devs, like my VMware dashboards.” Tie to your cluster docking experience.  
  **Resume Link**: Compare to your Microsoft stakeholder sync—both unite teams.

- [ ] **Stakeholder Management** (1 hour)  
  URL: https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/stakeholder-management-10058  
  Skim: “Stakeholder Engagement” (~5 pages).  
  Goal: Understand stakeholder mapping and communication plans. Learn terms: *RACI* (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), *escalation path* (resolving blockers). Focus on applying these to NVIDIA’s developer tools.  
  **Key Point**: “As a TPM, I’d map stakeholders to ensure tools like Nsight meet needs, like my VMware governance.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Explain: “I’d use RACI to clarify roles, like my Microsoft schedules avoided delays.” Be ready for conflict-resolution questions.  
  **Resume Link**: Tie to your VMware BI launch—both required stakeholder buy-in.

- [ ] **Conflict Resolution** (1 hour)  
  URL: https://hbr.org/2020/06/6-strategies-for-managing-workplace-conflicts  
  Read: Main article (~10 min).  
  Goal: Learn strategies like active listening and finding win-win solutions. Practice a scenario: e.g., engineering delays Nsight updates—how to mediate? Focus on keeping projects on track.  
  **Key Point**: “I’d resolve conflicts to keep NVIDIA tools on schedule, like my Microsoft provisioning avoided bottlenecks.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Say: “I’d listen to both sides and propose solutions, like my dashboards aligned teams.” Keep it practical, not theoretical.  
  **Resume Link**: Relate to your cluster docking—both solved team friction.

## Notes
- **Tech Buzz**: Collaboration is trending for AI project success. Say: “Online discussions stress team alignment for tools like CUDA.”  
- **GTC 2025**: Showcased Agile for AI toolchains—note “cross-functional sync” phrase.  
- **Avoid**: Don’t memorize frameworks—focus on practical TPM skills.  
- **Practice**: Explain collaboration in 2 sentences: “Collaboration aligns engineering and devs to deliver tools like Nsight. I’d drive sync with Agile, like my Microsoft projects.”
