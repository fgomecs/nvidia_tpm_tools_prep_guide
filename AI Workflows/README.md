# AI Workflows (Model Training and Inference)

**Why It Matters**: AI workflows, powered by tools like cuDNN and TensorRT, are central to NVIDIA’s developer ecosystem, enabling efficient model training and inference for AI applications like LLMs and computer vision—key to your Technical Program Manager role. As a TPM, you’ll coordinate these tools to optimize developer productivity. AI’s impact is buzzing on social platforms, with GTC 2025 showcasing NVIDIA’s AI stack for trillion-parameter models.

**Depth**: Grasp how cuDNN accelerates neural network training and TensorRT optimizes inference. Focus on their role in developer workflows (e.g., integrating with CUDA, DGX) and your TPM tasks (e.g., roadmapping, developer feedback). No need to dive into APIs—emphasize managing tool delivery and alignment with NVIDIA’s AI goals.

**Time**: 3-4 hours over 2 days.

**Resume Tie-In**: Your Microsoft provisioning (15,000 servers) and ML analytics project (Python, LSTM) show you can handle compute-heavy AI projects. Link AI workflows to your dashboards for tracking model deployment or stakeholder sync at VMware (10% tool adoption increase).

## Checklist

- [ ] **cuDNN Overview** (1 hour)  
  URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn  
  Read: Main page and “Features” section.  
  Goal: Understand cuDNN as a GPU-accelerated library for deep neural networks, optimizing operations like convolutions and attention for AI training. It integrates with frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.  
  **Key Point**: “cuDNN speeds up AI training by optimizing GPU tasks, enabling faster model development.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Say: “cuDNN enhances training efficiency, and I’d ensure its tools meet developer needs, like my Microsoft ops dashboards.” Tie to your ML analytics project.  
  **Resume Link**: Compare to your predictive analytics system—both optimize compute tasks.

- [ ] **TensorRT for Inference** (1-2 hours)  
  URL: https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt  
  Watch: First 15 min of GTC 2025 talk (https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/on-demand/session/gtcspring25-a41249/).  
  Goal: Learn TensorRT as an SDK for low-latency, high-throughput inference, optimizing models for deployment on GPUs (e.g., Blackwell, RTX). Note its use in AI apps like chatbots and autonomous driving.  
  **Key Point**: “TensorRT streamlines inference, and I’d manage its updates to boost developer workflows, like my VMware governance.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Explain: “TensorRT cuts inference latency, like my dashboards cut downtime at Microsoft.” Be honest about learning optimization details on the job.  
  **Resume Link**: Tie to your VMware BI team launch—both improve performance.

- [ ] **AI Workflows for TPMs** (1 hour)  
  URL: https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/workflows/  
  Skim: Intro and “AI Pipeline” (~5 pages).  
  Goal: Understand the AI pipeline: data prep (e.g., RAPIDS), training (cuDNN, NeMo), inference (TensorRT). Learn terms: *fine-tuning* (adjusting pre-trained models), *quantization* (reducing model size). Focus on coordinating these as a TPM.  
  **Key Point**: “As a TPM, I’d streamline AI workflows by aligning tools like cuDNN and TensorRT with developer needs, like my Microsoft schedules.”  
  **Interview Tip**: Say: “AI workflows combine training and inference, and I’d prioritize usability, like my ML analytics project.” Skip math-heavy details.  
  **Resume Link**: Relate to your Python analytics—both handle complex data flows.

## Notes
- **Social Buzz**: AI workflows are trending for speeding up LLMs. Say: “I’ve seen cuDNN and TensorRT praised online for AI efficiency.”  
- **GTC 2025**: Highlighted TensorRT-LLM for billion-parameter models—note “low-latency inference” buzzword.  
- **Avoid**: Don’t study model architectures—focus on tools and TPM roles.  
- **Practice**: Explain AI workflows in 2 sentences: “cuDNN and TensorRT accelerate AI training and inference on GPUs. I’d manage their delivery to empower developers, like my Microsoft projects.”
